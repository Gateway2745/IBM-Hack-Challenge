# IBM Hack Challenge

- Refer to Friend-affinity-finder.pdf for the details on problem statement .
- The project consists of 2 servers
- First server is wriiten on flask. It collects data from twitter, stack, etc .
- Second server is written on node. It provides the interface for user to interact with .
  It also has the ML model that performs k means clustering analysis to get categories of friends .

## TODOs
- Make the following pages for frontend and link them with node endpoints. Note that UI/UX will be given a good amount of wieghtage.
    - Login Page
    - Registration Page ( we will also take user's social media usernames here)
    - Page to add friends and get their friend affinity
    - Page to list all friends vs category ( i.e. for clustering )
    - Partial for menu/navigation bar
    - Do data visualisation using some charting library
    
- Update backend endpoints according to the frontend requirements.

- Upload the ideation document in .doc or .pdf format with font size 12, single spacing, Times New Roman font. 
    The document should include the following details only:
    - What is the uniqueness/novelty added by you to the defined problem statement?
    - How is the proposed solution impacting the business? How are the business processes simplified or bringing value over the existing process?
    - Architectural flow of the proposed solution, with the mention of technologies to be used in developing the solution.
    - Define the scope of work to be implemented in the project with modules etc.
