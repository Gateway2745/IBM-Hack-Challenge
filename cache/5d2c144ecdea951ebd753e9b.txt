If Democrats want to unite around the foul language &amp; racist hatred spewed from the mouths and actions of these very unpopular &amp; unrepresentative Congresswomen, it will be interesting to see how it plays out. I can tell you that they have made Israel feel abandoned by the U.S. When will the Radical Left Congresswomen apologize to our Country, the people of Israel and even to the Office of the President, for the foul language they have used, and the terrible things they have said. So many people are angry at them &amp; their horrible &amp; disgusting actions! ....with the U.S., and wishes it had not broken the original deal in the first place.

China‚Äôs 2nd Quarter growth is the slowest it has been in more than 27 years. The United States Tariffs are having a major effect on companies wanting to leave China for non-tariffed countries. Thousands of companies are leaving. This is why China wants to make a deal.... We are doing great Economically as a Country, Number One, despite the Fed‚Äôs antiquated policy on rates and tightening. Much room to grow! ....and the many terrible things they say about the United States must not be allowed to go unchallenged. If the Democrat Party wants to continue to condone such disgraceful behavior, then we look even more forward to seeing you at the ballot box in 2020! So sad to see the Democrats sticking up for people who speak so badly of our Country and who, in addition, hate Israel with a true and unbridled passion.

Recent ‚Äústrained‚Äù decisions by the United States Supreme Court, some so simple as allowing the question, ‚ÄúAre you a citizen of the United States‚Äù on our very expensive Census Report, or the even more strained decisions (2) allowing the world‚Äôs most expensive &amp; pathetic...... India has long had a field day putting Tariffs on American products. No longer acceptable! Food Stamp participation hits 10 year low. Wow! @OANN ‚ÄúWith President Trump at the helm, not only is America getting great again, but he‚Äôs going to make our estuaries, our rivers, our water - everything better - the things he is doing, and done, are just helping America tremendously.‚Äù Thank you to Bruce Hrobak @foxandfriends Outrage is growing in the Great State of Minnesota where our Patriots are now having to fight for the right to say the Pledge of Allegiance. I will be fighting with you! @foxandfriends ‚ÄúI agree with the President, the Supreme Court got it wrong. There should be a question about Citizenship on the Census. A.G. Barr sees a pathway to add the Citizenship Question.‚Äù  Steve Doocy @foxandfriends  Working hard on something that should be so easy. People are fed up! ....and they are both only getting bigger, better and stronger.....Thank you, Mr. President! ...handled. I told @theresa_may how to do that deal, but she went her own foolish way-was unable to get it done. A disaster! I don‚Äôt know the Ambassador but have been told he is a pompous fool. Tell him the USA now has the best Economy &amp; Military  anywhere in the World, by far... The wacky Ambassador that the U.K. foisted upon the United States is not someone we are thrilled with, a very stupid guy. He should speak to his country, and Prime Minister May, about their failed Brexit negotiation, and not be upset with my criticism of how badly it was... Very good numbers on the economy. Much potential for growth. Trade deals being negotiated or being set up for negotiation. We have been treated very unfairly (to put it mildly) by other countries for many years, but that is changing! c# java .net linq string generics date timezone multithreading reflection Mod from this subreddit removing my post with 58k upvotes just because the mod thought it was fake.

You're going to see that same model of car everywhere. That's because it's at the front of your mind.

If you're currently thinking negatively. Practice to think positively. If you're thinking positively, your mind will put it forward and you'll be happier. 

Now if you've just given up and not trying to think positively, you're going to think negatively all the time because your mind put it forward.

So try thinking positively. Have a good day and happy summer. Discussion [removed] Easy to do biotope? I wanna do a biotope for my 36 gallon bowfront. I have a list of things I dont wanna do.

Can you guys help? https://www.homedepot.ca/product/skil-16-inch-scroll-saw-with-light/1001022558

I (14m) am interested in the art type of wood working. My father is in the construction area of woodworking so he wont be able to help me here so I have come to you guys. 

Is this scroll saw worth it? It only has one speed which I'm worried about. It seems like a decent one, within my budget (200 CAD or less) if it is a good one for a beginner. I have a list of specific questions I'll put in a list for easier reading.

1. What blades are compatible with this saw?

2. Are there different types of blades? If so, what ones should I buy?

3. I'm not a fan of plywood, what kind of wood am  I able to cut with this saw?

4. Are there different types of wood I should use? Such as something like cedar or pine? I decided to make a new account so I'm going to be posting all of my projects again. Here is the uncarpeted cat tree.  Doggo must protecc  My little baby Luna and I like to cuddle.  Can anyone help me find the seed of these guys?
